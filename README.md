DZAINotificationCenterPlugin
============================

An Adium plugin for sending notifications under OS X Mountain Lion and newer.

Now with user pictures support on OS X >= 10.9.

Why a separate plugin for this? Well, Adium developers don't seem to care about
this particular feature and trying to find the responsible code makes my head
ache.
